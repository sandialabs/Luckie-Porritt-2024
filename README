Code used in Luckie & Porritt (2023)

Example Python script which demonstrates functionality of beamforming, waveform simulation framework (WSF), noise modelling, and back-projection from Luckie & Porritt (2023).

Python script is presented in luckie_porritt_DAS_geom.ipynb.

See env.yml for list of packages used to run the Jupyter Notebook.



Detailed description
This set of files contains Python code which provides example calculations and plots used in the analysis of Luckie & Porritt (2023), currently submitted to the open access journal Seismica. Publication of this software will lead to adoption in the related academic fields. Developments from academic research will improve Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology that can then be used to further our mission-specific objectives.

The Jupyter Notebook (luckie_porritt_DAS_geom.ipynb) performs calculations using a set of Python scripts (*.py) and plots the results. Calculations are performed using synthetic data and a simple, representative seismic array geometry. This includes calculating a synthetic waveform given representative source-receiver geometries, beamforming to assess how a sample array responds to a seismic arrival, the generation of synthetic noise, and back-projection to locate a nearby synthetic source. The synthetic waveform and back-projection calculations have previously been validated through prior scientific publications. The novelty of this code stems from the fact that it is applied to high spatial and temporal density DAS data and can accurately replicate Earth noise in synthetic data.
